🔐 Mod 26 – picoCTF Beginner Guide

Author: Pandu
Category: Cryptography
Difficulty: Easy
📝 Description

Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?
Ciphertext:
cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_nSkgmDJE}
🧠 What’s This About?

This challenge is based on ROT13, a basic cipher that shifts letters 13 positions forward. It’s reversible — applying ROT13 again gives you the original text.
🛠️ Tool Used

    CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

🧩 Steps

    Open CyberChef.

    Add the ROT13 operation.

    Ensure "Rotate lower case chars" and "Rotate upper case chars" are checked.

    Paste the ciphertext into the input box.

    The output appears instantly.

✅ Output

picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_aFxtzQWR}
🧠 What I Learned

    ROT13 is symmetric.

    CyberChef is useful for basic decoding.

    Even simple ciphers can hide flags well.

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?
🧠 What’s This About?

This is a simple hexadecimal to decimal conversion challenge — testing your understanding of number systems used in computing.
🧩 Solution

0x3D is a hexadecimal number.
To convert it to decimal:

    0x3D = 3 × 16 + 13 = 48 + 13 = 61

    Final answer: 61

You can also use the terminal:

echo $((0x3D))

✅ Flag

picoCTF{61}

🧠 What I Learned

    Hex (base 16) uses 0–9 and A–F (A=10, F=15).

    Prefix 0x denotes hexadecimal.

    Quick mental or terminal-based conversions are handy in CTFs.

Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?
🧠 What’s This About?

This challenge tests your ability to convert a decimal number to binary, a fundamental concept in computer science.
🧩 Solution

Convert 42 to binary:

    42 ÷ 2 = 21 → remainder 0

    21 ÷ 2 = 10 → remainder 1

    10 ÷ 2 = 5 → remainder 0

    5 ÷ 2 = 2 → remainder 1

    2 ÷ 2 = 1 → remainder 0

    1 ÷ 2 = 0 → remainder 1

Write remainders in reverse: 101010

Or use terminal:

echo "obase=2; 42" | bc

✅ Flag

picoCTF{101010}

🧠 What I Learned

    Binary is base 2, using only 0 and 1.

    Decimal to binary conversion is common in CTFs.

    You can use tools like bc in Linux to convert between number systems.

What does this string mean?

bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1

Hint: It has something to do with bases.
🧠 What’s This About?

This is a Base64 decoding challenge. The string given looks like Base64 — a common encoding format used to safely transmit binary data as ASCII text.
🛠️ Tool Used

    CyberChef or command-line base64 decoder

🧩 Solution

Decode the string using any of the following:

CyberChef:

    Drag "From Base64" into the Recipe

    Paste input: bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1

Linux terminal:

echo bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 | base64 -d

Output:

l3arn_th3_r0p35

✅ Flag

picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}

🧠 What I Learned

    Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate data in CTFs

    The output is usually readable text or a flag

    Tools like CyberChef or terminal commands make decoding quick and easy
